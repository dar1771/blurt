/// back to preinstall without a terminal.
///
/// The one thing the script does that this can't is the LaunchServices
/// unregister sweep: that clears *other* copies of the app (DerivedData, stale
/// checkouts), which is a developer's problem and not something a running copy
/// can meaningfully do to itself. The script also covers both bundle ids, where
/// a running app can only reset its own.
///
/// **Not `Sendable`, and it doesn't need to be**: it is built and run in one
/// synchronous step on the main actor, from the Settings window's reset button.
/// The four steps are closures so the whole thing is exercisable without
/// touching the developer's own defaults, Keychain item, TCC rows, or logs —
/// `run()` is otherwise a function whose every effect is irreversible and
/// machine-wide, which is the last shape you want covered only by reading it.
