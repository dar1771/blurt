/// The press-time Accessibility read, and the one place it is published: waited
/// on with a budget when the request opens, peeked at afterwards.
///
/// It exists because the streaming route split one reader into two with
/// different deadlines. `config` leads the request body, so
/// `DictationSession.startUpload` cannot wait past `contextWaitBudget` for a
/// cross-process read without holding the audio back — and that budget is spent
/// against a read that has only had the mic bring-up to finish in, not the whole
/// recording as it did when the wait lived on the release path. Two readers are
/// left needing the same value on a *later* deadline:
///
/// - the paste separator (`inject`, via `priorText`/`windowTitle`), and
/// - the remember-this-dictation decision, which is the one that matters. A nil
///   context reads as "not a password field" (`TranscriptionContext.isEmpty`
///   documents why the flag cannot survive being collapsed to nil), so a
///   dictation into a secure field would be recorded into `recentDictations` and
///   replayed in `stt_prompt` on every later dictation this launch.
///   That is precisely the leak `targetIsSecure` exists to prevent, and a merely
///   slow target — `FocusCapture` makes ~6 serial AX round trips, each capped at
///   ~1 s — must not be enough to open it.
///
/// So `wait(within:clock:)` is the deadline-bound read the upload needs and
/// `resolved` is the peek the release path needs, over one stored value. Holding
/// both here rather than beside each other on the actor is what makes the
/// ordering unforgeable: `store(resolved:)` writes the value *then* publishes to
/// the stream, so a waiter that sees the stream finish can never find the value
/// missing, and no call site can get that backwards.
///
/// `pressKnown` is the other half of the same problem, and needs no
/// synchronization: it is what the actor already knew at press — key terms and
/// the recent-dictation ring, no focus signals — set once and never written
/// again. It used to be discarded along with the field text whenever the budget
/// was missed, because the same `TranscriptionContext` carried both. Kept apart,
/// a timeout costs the request only what actually failed to arrive, so
/// `keyterms_prompt` and the recent-dictation turns still reach the wire.
///
/// A `Mutex`-backed reference type for the same reason `UploadProgress` is one:
/// the writer is a Dispatch block that cannot touch the actor, and `Mutex` is
/// non-copyable so it cannot be passed or captured directly.
