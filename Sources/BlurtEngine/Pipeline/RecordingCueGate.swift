/// staying silent while a phase repeats and across transitions between two
/// non-recording phases. Value type holding a single edge bit; the host owns one
/// instance for the app's lifetime.

/// The edge is `.recording` specifically, **not** "a press happened". In
/// production the press first claims `.connecting` while `MicCapture`'s liveness
/// gate waits for the input route to deliver frames, so the chime rides the
/// connecting→recording edge by construction — it sounds when audio is actually
/// flowing, not when the key went down. That ordering is the point: the chime is
/// a "speak now" cue, and on a Bluetooth route the two moments are ~1–2 s apart,
/// during which nothing is captured. Chiming at the press invites the user to
/// speak into a dead mic and loses the first words of the utterance.
