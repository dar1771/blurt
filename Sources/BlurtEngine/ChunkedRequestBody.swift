/// A `CFStream` bound pair standing in for a request body that does not exist
/// yet: `URLSession` reads `input` as the upload body while `drain` writes the
/// audio into `output` as the microphone produces it.
///
/// Why a bound pair rather than something nicer: as of the macOS 26 SDK there
/// is no `URLSession` API that accepts an `AsyncSequence` as a request body.
/// Every streaming-upload path — `URLRequest.httpBodyStream` and
/// `uploadTask(withStreamedRequest:)` alike — ultimately wants an
/// `InputStream`, so manufacturing one is unavoidable. `uploadTask` is the
/// documented path but has no `async` form, which would cost the whole
/// data-collecting/completion delegate; `httpBodyStream` keeps the
/// `data(for:delegate:)` ergonomics and pairs with a `needNewBodyStream`
/// delegate that refuses a replay (see `DictationUploadDelegate`).
///
/// Not setting `Content-Length` is what makes the upload chunked: `URLSession`
/// falls back to `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (or streamed HTTP/2 DATA frames)
/// when the body length is unknown, which is precisely the case a live
/// recording is in.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` by confinement: `input` is handed to `URLSession` in
/// `upload(for:streaming:delegate:)` and never touched here again, and `output`
/// is touched only by the single task running `drain`.
