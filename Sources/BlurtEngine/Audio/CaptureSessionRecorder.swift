/// The capture backend (owner-directed move to `AVCaptureSession`, 2026-08-25):
/// a session built fresh per capture around a single audio device — the device
/// pinned in Settings when one is set, the system default otherwise — whose data
/// output converts to the dictation API's 16 kHz mono 16-bit LPCM on the fly and
/// delivers it here as sample buffers, published straight onto `frames` for the
/// upload to drain and tallied by byte count. No temp file, no resample pass, no
/// decode on the release path — and no second copy of the utterance held in
/// memory, because the bytes leave as they arrive.
///
/// Used directly by `MicCapture` rather than through a protocol. There *was* a
/// `CaptureRecorder` seam, and its whole job was to let the actor's machinery —
/// liveness gate, meter, tail linger — be written once across two backends (an
/// `AVAudioRecorder` WAV path and a device-pinned `AudioQueue`). Both are gone,
/// so the seam abstracted a single conformer with no test double behind it; the
/// contract it documented now lives on these members. `MicCaptureProtocol` is
/// the seam hosts and tests actually inject at.
///
/// Fresh-per-session is load-bearing: the session's input is attached to one
/// device at build time and never re-resolves, so a session outliving a device
/// switch would record the wrong mic (or silence) rather than failing loudly.
/// `MicCapture` builds one per press and drops it at stop.
///
/// Building the session does **not** engage the microphone: measured against
/// CoreAudio's own `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere`, the bit
/// behind the input indicator, it stays clear until `record()`. Building is also
/// cheap next to opening. `MicCapture.warmUp()` holds the full measurement and
/// what follows from it (no warm-recorder lifecycle, and nothing worth
/// pre-paying but the process's first touch).
///
/// Hardware-bound like `MicCapture`, and excluded from the coverage gate for
/// the same reason; its live test rides the `BLURT_LIVE_AUDIO_TESTS` gate in
/// `AudioInputDevicesTests`.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable`: `MicCapture.start()`'s liveness probes read
/// `deliveredFrames` and `meteredPowerDB()` off-actor, safe by confinement —
/// the polls run sequentially in one task while `start()` is suspended and
/// nothing else references the recorder in that window. The session/output
/// handles are configured in `init` and then only read, and everything the
