/// opens the device with. `uniqueID` *is* the CoreAudio device UID string on
/// macOS, so the picker lists exactly the devices `CaptureSessionRecorder` can
/// pin to, and "the pin resolves" and "the recorder can open it" are one fact
/// rather than two that could disagree.
///
/// `transportType` is the same four-character code CoreAudio's
/// `kAudioDevicePropertyTransportType` reports — confirmed against real hardware
/// for every case the policies care about: `blue` on AirPods, `bltn` on the
/// built-in mic, `usb ` on USB interfaces, `virt` on virtual devices and `grup`
/// on an aggregate. That confirmation is what retired the parallel CoreAudio
/// read this file used to keep (a device-list read, an input-stream filter, a
/// `CFString` property bridge and a UID→`AudioDeviceID` translation, ~60 lines).
/// The Bluetooth case was the one worth being slow about: a transport that
/// failed to read as Bluetooth silently costs the 2.5 s liveness cap and the
/// 220 ms tail linger, which is the missing-last-word bug both exist to fix.
///
/// Raw reads only — the policy for a UID that no longer resolves is
/// `MicDeviceSelection.effective`, and what a transport *means* is
/// `AudioTransport`; both are pure and unit-tested. This file needs real
/// hardware to answer anything, so it is excluded from the coverage gate and
