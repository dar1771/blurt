/// `TranscriberProtocol` backed by AssemblyAI's **dictation** API.
///
/// A single `POST dictation.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe/live` carries a JSON
/// `config` part plus the captured audio (raw S16LE PCM, exactly the bytes the
/// mic recorded — there is no re-encoding pass), and the response body carries
/// both the verbatim transcript and an LLM-rewritten version with disfluencies
/// removed, produced by applying `CleanupInstruction.text` server-side.
///
/// **Every request asks for that rewrite** — `llm_instruction` rides the config
/// unconditionally, and the config carries no on/off switch at all. Which of the
/// two transcripts gets pasted is decided on the *response*, by the "enhanced
/// transcripts" setting (on by default): see `transcript(from:)`, which also
/// states what that costs a user who has it off.
/// No upload step, no job submission, no polling — one
/// request per utterance covers transcription *and* cleanup. `config` leads the
/// body because the streaming route cannot open its upstream call without it —
/// see `transcribePath` and `streamedBody`. The service picks
/// the STT model server-side and accepts **at most 120 s** of audio (the
/// documented cap; there is no documented *minimum* — the ~80 ms floor is this
/// client's own, see `SyncSTTLimits.minPCMBytes`). The rewrite is best-effort
/// with a 5 s server-side deadline, so a failure still returns the verbatim
/// transcript (`llm_response` null, `llm_error` set).
///
/// **Every request this file makes is one the reference describes** — path,
/// header, part order, config keys, response keys, error keys. That is a
/// standing rule, not an accident of the current shape: measured-but-
/// undocumented behaviour is not something to build on, however well it works.
/// `llm: null` is the one that was removed for it (see
/// `DictationConfig.llmInstruction`). The single header the reference does not
/// mention is `User-Agent`, which every HTTP client sends regardless — see
/// `UserAgent` for why naming Blurt and its version there is not an exception
/// to the rule above but a request the rule never governed.
