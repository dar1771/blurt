// The dictation API's JSON contract: the `config` part `AssemblyAITranscriber`
// encodes, and the success/error bodies it decodes. Split from
// `AssemblyAITranscriber.swift` to stay within the lint file-length budget —
// that file is the transport (multipart framing, timeouts, metrics), this one is
// the wire shape. Nested in the transcriber, and internal rather than private,
// only because Swift's `private` is file-scoped and cannot cross the split.
//
// Every field name here was swept against the live route on 2026-09-10, because
// the route validates its config **strictly**: an unrecognized key earns
// `400 invalid config part: <key>: Extra inputs are not permitted`, exactly as a
// deliberately bogus one does. The reference says the opposite about this
// endpoint — "Over HTTP, unknown fields are forwarded to the transcription
// engine as-is" — but re-measured 2026-09-11, a config carrying
// `blurt_probe_bogus_key: 1` earns `400 invalid config part:
// blurt_probe_bogus_key: Extra inputs are not permitted`.
//
// **The docs are the source of truth for what to send, and that disagreement
// does not change what this file does**: every key below is one the reference
// documents, so nothing here depends on unknown fields being either forwarded or
// rejected. Keep it that way and the question stays academic.
//
// The corollary is the one that bites. The route *accepts* more names than the
// reference lists — `prompt`, `keyterms`, `word_boost` and `language_code` are
// all live, and the docs call the first three legacy aliases — so a 200 is not
// evidence a field is supported, only that it has not been removed yet. There
// has been a lot of renaming on this route. Treat any name absent from the docs
// as deprecated and don't send it, however well it works today.

    /// no off switch, and the *response* is where the enhanced-transcripts
    /// setting chooses between the two transcripts
    /// (`AssemblyAITranscriber.transcript(from:)`).
    ///
    /// An explicit null `llm` does suppress the rewrite — measured 2026-09-10 and
    /// re-confirmed 2026-09-11 (200, with `llm_response` and `llm_error` both
