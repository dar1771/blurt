  /// name in update alerts, and the release feed the update check reads.
  ///
  /// This is the composition root: the identity belongs to the host, and a fork
  /// or a second embedder replaces exactly these lines rather than hunting
  /// constants through the engine. Earliest hook a SwiftUI `App` has, which is
  /// what `HostIdentity.configure(_:)` asks for.
  ///
  /// **Which** identity depends on which app this is. Debug builds ship as
  /// `dev.alex.blurt.dev` / "Blurt Dev" (see `project.yml`), which macOS already
  /// treats as a separate app — its own TCC rows, its own defaults domain — but
  /// *not* its own Keychain item, since Keychain items are per login keychain
  /// rather than per app. Shared, a dev build read the shipping app's API key,
  /// could overwrite it, and could delete it outright through Settings → Reset.
  /// `.blurtDev` differs from `.blurt` in exactly that one field.
  ///
  /// Decided from the **running bundle id** rather than `#if DEBUG`: the id is
  /// what actually makes these two apps to macOS, and it follows
  /// `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, so a configuration added later gets the dev
  /// identity by default (the same reasoning that made the debug id the default
  /// in `project.yml`) instead of silently reaching for the shipping key because
  /// someone forgot a compilation condition. `HostIdentity.blurt.subsystem` is
  /// the shipping id — the one place that string is written down.
