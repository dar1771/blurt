/// area where the user lists comma-separated domain words (names, jargon, product
/// names). These are sent as every dictation request's word-boost list
/// (see `KeyTermsStore` / `KeytermsBoost`), so the model favors those exact

  /// deliberately exposes no setter. Normalization happens on read instead —
  /// `KeyTermsStore.raw` trims, and `parse` trims and dedupes each term — so a
  /// blank field still reads back as "no terms". A normalizing setter fought the
  /// text field: it wrote a second, differently-normalized value on every
  /// keystroke, `@AppStorage` observed that as an external write and pushed the
  /// trimmed string back into the binding, so a trailing space was deleted as the
  /// user typed it and could never be entered at all.
