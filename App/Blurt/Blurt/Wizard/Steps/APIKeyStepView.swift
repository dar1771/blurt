/// Shaped the way macOS treats a third-party service credential (HIG "Managing
/// accounts" — the pattern behind System Settings › Internet Accounts, Mail's
/// account list, and Xcode › Settings › Accounts): the pane carries a **status
/// row** showing the connection's identity and state plus one button, and the
/// credential itself is entered in a **sheet**, which is where a modal task with
/// an explicit commit-or-cancel belongs.
///
/// Two deliberate departures from the neighbouring permission rows:
///
/// - The row shows the stored key's last four characters, not the green
///   checkmark `PermissionsStepView` uses. A permission is on or off; an account
///   has an identity, and "which key is this?" is the question a checkmark can't
///   answer.
/// - The button titles carry ellipses ("Connect…", "Change…") because they need
///   more input before the action completes — the same rule that already gives
///   "Open Accessibility Settings…" its ellipsis.
///
/// Everything the row can't hold — why a key is needed at all, where it's
/// stored, how to get one, and what went wrong when AssemblyAI rejects one —
/// lives in the sheet, which has room for it without crowding the form.
