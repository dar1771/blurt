// Neither window is a hand-rolled `NSWindow`: both are SwiftUI scenes declared in
// `BlurtApp`. These types are the glue between those scenes and the long-lived
// models the app delegate owns.
//
// - Main window (`MainWindow`): the primary window, a `Window` scene opened via
//   `openWindow(id:)`. While the app isn't fully configured it shows the setup
//   wizard; once it is, it shows `ReadyView` (the shortcut readout).
// - Settings (`SettingsWindowRoot`): change the API key or dictation shortcut.
//   An explicit window id lets the app menu, ready screen, and menu bar open it.

  /// a hard-coded box.
  ///
  /// Shared rather than restated per view because the main window swaps

  /// and 45 under the shortcut readout before the controls begin.
  ///
  /// Here rather than private to `ReadyView` because its content views own
  /// their own captions — `RecentDictationsSection` draws the "Recent" label
