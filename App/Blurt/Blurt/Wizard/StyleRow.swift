/// The style switcher: a labelled pop-up in the same warm card as the Recent
/// list below it, so the window's two in-content surfaces match. **Default** is
/// the base styling (no profile instructions appended) and the rest of the menu
/// is the user's profiles; a divider then separates the one item that isn't a
/// style at all, **Edit Styles…**, which opens Settings deep-linked to the
/// Advanced pane where profiles are created and edited (see
/// `SettingsWindowRoot`'s Styles section). This row owns only which style is in
/// effect.
///
/// A pop-up rather than a row of buttons or a segmented control, because style
/// names are user-authored and this card has a fixed width. A segmented
/// `Picker` reports its full-label width as its *minimum*: neither
/// `.lineLimit(1)` nor a `.frame(maxWidth:)` cap makes it truncate — the first
/// is ignored and the second just clips, drawing the control over its
/// neighbours — and at the reachable worst case (five segments at the
/// 24-character `nameLimit`) it pushed the caption and both card edges out of
/// the 480 pt window. A row of separate buttons solved that by tail-truncating
/// the names, and a pop-up keeps the same bargain in a smaller space: only one
/// item shows at a time, and `Bar` below holds every item — the names it
/// shortens, the "Edit Styles…" it pads — to one measured budget, so the bar
/// is a fixed width that fills the row and **no style a user can name will
/// ever grow it**.
///
/// The row sits between the shortcut readout and the Recent list because which
/// style is in effect is the one dictation setting worth changing mid-flow. The
/// choice is **sticky**: a selection holds until the user makes another, so a
/// switch is not something to redo before every dictation.

    // there is nothing left for it to hold: the bar takes the width the label
    // doesn't.

    // The bar fills the row, but nothing here asks it to: a macOS pop-up hugs
    // its widest *item*, and `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` widens only the
    // frame — the bar then draws at its own width, centered in it, adrift in
    // the card. (Checked against a scratch app: a `Picker` with labels hidden
    // at either alignment, and a `Menu` plain or with a `Spacer` in its label,
    // all behave the same. Filling it for real would mean wrapping
    // `NSPopUpButton` with hugging turned off — an AppKit representable for a
    // cosmetic gain.) So the width comes from the item text instead, in `Bar`
