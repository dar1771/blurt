/// Launch-time performance guard. Deliberately *not* a `BlurtUITestCase`
/// subclass: that base launches the app in `setUp`, but this test owns the
/// launch so it can time it. Swift Testing has no performance API, so this stays
/// XCTest.
///
/// Like the engine perf tests, this asserts an explicit budget rather than an
/// XCTest baseline (baselines are device-keyed and wouldn't gate on CI). The
/// budget is generous versus the ~0.4 s cold launch measured locally — enough
/// headroom for slower CI hardware, tight enough to catch a launch that
/// regresses into seconds (e.g. synchronous work added to
/// `applicationDidFinishLaunching`).
